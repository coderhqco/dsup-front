              The Democracy, Straight-Up! Project offers a free Voter
              Verification Service for district voters using this Portal. We can
              ensure that, once your DcL has reached a quorum, starting on the
              first day your Straight-Up rep is casting their votes on the floor
              of the US House of Representatives, the vote totals they’ll get
              from The Portal will be made up of only voters in your district to
              an accuracy of at least 99.99! And, if you want a higher rate we
              will help you get there.
            </p>

              This does mean that before your DcL reaches a quorum, it will be
              in its “awkward phase.” That is another service of The Democracy,
              Straight-Up! Project—helping you get your voter-legislature up and
              running at full strength.

              In the meantime, there is a lot you can do to speed the process
              along, and to build the capacity and efficiency of your district’s
              stake in direct democracy in America!
